## Formatted input and output

In the previous chapters we have seen a lot of times that `printf` being used in many programs. The `printf` is an API that logs or prints the input on to
the console. The console in our case is the terminal screen.

`printf` does this in an even nicer way by using format specifiers. They allow the calling program to print the different sets of data types.

The formatted input and output is used to take input and output in a specific format. The header file used for this one is `stdio.h`.

### printf and sub functions

`printf` is a very useful API to print the message in a formatted way on to the console or to `stdout`. The `printf` usage is very simple as below.

```c
printf("value is %d\n", value);
```

The print format of the data types is as follows. The same can be used for `scanf` set of API.

|format | datatype |
|-------|----------|
| %d | int |
| %s | string|
| %u | unsigned int |
| %ld | long integer |
| %jd | long 64 bit signed integer |
| %ju | long 64 bit unsigned integer |
| %f | float |
| %lf | double |

`fprintf` is another API that prints on to a file pointer. In most of the cases, this file pointer is sometimes the console (`stdout`) or the `stderr`.

The `fprintf` usage is same as the `printf` but the first aguement to it is a file.

```c
FILE *fp = stderr;

fprintf(fp, "value is %d\n", value);
```

The difference between the `stdout` and `stderr` is that the later is not buffered and directly the messages will be dumped on to the console.
The `stdout` instead buffers the input and dumps it later. The difference can easily be viewed when debugging a big loop.

There is another API that prints to a buffer in the formatted way just as `printf`. This API we call it `sprintf`. The `sprintf` usage is very simple as below.


```c
sprintf(buf, "value is %d\n", value);
```

A problem with the `sprintf` is that if the print length is more than the size of the buffer, the buffer overflow may occur and the program may stop. The better function is `snprintf`.

The `snprintf` has the length argument and the length is always checked before writing into the data.

The `snprintf` example is as follows.

```c
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "value is %d\n", value);
```

### scanf and sub functions

`scanf` is a very useful API to read strings in a suitable format from the console or from the `stdin`. The `scanf` usage is very simple as below.

```c
scanf("%s %d", string, integer);
```

There is another function that 
Although `scanf` is really useful in reading the strings in the format the user wants, it sometimes gives us data that we did not expect.

There is a similar API that reads instead from the buffer called `sscanf`. This API we call it `sscanf`. The `sscanf` usage is very simple as below.

```c
sscanf(buf, "%s %d", string, integer);
```

### variadic functions

The variadic functions allows the user to write own `printf` like functions that are customizable for the project purposes. They all include the `stdarg.h`.

The `stdarg.h` uses the following APIs: `va_start`, `va_list`, `va_arg` and `va_end`.

```c
void dev_printf(char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list ap;
    
    va_start(ap, fmt);
    vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap);
    va_end(ap);
}
```

### variadic macros

`gcc` provides a useful feature called variadic macro that allows us to define our own printf style macros. The usual format is

```c
#define dprintf(...) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)
```
